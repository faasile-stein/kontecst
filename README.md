# Kontecst

> Platform for versioned, queryable context for AI agents—served via API or managed vector stores.

## What is Kontecst?

Kontecst lets developers and teams curate structured `.md` files, version them, and serve them to LLM agents as raw Markdown, via an API, or through fully managed vector stores backed by Postgres/pgvector.

### Key Features

- **Kontecst Packages** → Collections of `.md` files with metadata and versioning
- **Versioning** → Immutable snapshots on publish with semver
- **Kontecst Editor** → Guided, AI-assisted Markdown editor
- **Feeds** → Public or private distribution channels for knowledge
- **Multiple Serving Modes**:
  - Raw `.md` files
  - REST/GraphQL API
  - PostgreSQL vector store (shared or dedicated)
- **Embeddings Pipeline** → Automatic chunking, embedding, and indexing
- **Enterprise Features** → SSO, audit logs, dedicated databases, data residency

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- pnpm 8+
- Docker Desktop (for local Supabase)

### Installation

**Option 1: Local Development with Supabase (Recommended)**

Perfect for trying out Kontecst or local development:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/kontecst.git
cd kontecst

# Run automated local setup (installs CLI, starts Supabase, configures everything!)
./scripts/setup-local.sh
```

This script automatically:
- ✅ Installs Supabase CLI if needed
- ✅ Starts local Supabase (Postgres, Auth, Storage, etc.)
- ✅ Extracts and configures credentials
- ✅ Creates all `.env` files
- ✅ Optionally starts dev servers

Visit http://localhost:3000 to see the app!

See [docs/LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md) for detailed instructions.

**Option 2: Production Setup with Supabase Cloud**

For production or cloud-based development:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/kontecst.git
cd kontecst

# Run automated setup
pnpm setup

# Configure .env files with:
# - Supabase URL and keys (from your Supabase project)
# - OpenAI API key (for embeddings and semantic search)
# - Encryption key (generated by setup script)

# Start all services
pnpm dev:start
```

**Option 3: Manual Setup**

For full control over the setup process:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/kontecst.git
cd kontecst

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Copy environment variables
cp .env.example .env
cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env
cp apps/proxy/.env.example apps/proxy/.env

# Generate encryption key
openssl rand -hex 32

# Configure .env files with credentials
# ...

# Start Docker services (if not using local Supabase)
pnpm docker:up

# Start development servers
pnpm dev
```

This will start:
- Next.js web app on `http://localhost:3000`
- File proxy service on `http://localhost:3001`
- PostgreSQL with pgvector on `localhost:5432`

**Development Commands:**

```bash
pnpm dev:start    # Start all services (automated)
pnpm dev:stop     # Stop all services
pnpm dev:status   # Check service status
pnpm docker:logs  # View Docker logs
```

## Use Cases

### For AI Builders
Provide accurate, controlled context to your AI agents with version control and access management.

### For Enterprises
Private, secure, versioned knowledge base for internal AI agents with audit logging and compliance features.

### For Open Source Creators
Publish public "context packages" that users can subscribe to and query.

- **Backend**: Fastify (TypeScript, Node.js)
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + pgvector)
- **Deployment**: Vercel (frontend), Docker containers (proxy + dedicated DBs)
- **Auth**: Supabase Auth
- **Payments**: Stripe
